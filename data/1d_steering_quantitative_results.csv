2. **Uncertainty principle**: It's impossible to precisely measure certain properties of quantum objects, such as position and momentum, simultaneously. The act of measurement itself affects the outcome, introducing uncertainty.
3. **Superposition**: Quantum objects can exist in multiple states simultaneously, which is known as a superposition of states. This means that quantum systems can exhibit multiple properties simultaneously, such as spin up and spin down at the same time.

**What is quantum mechanics?**

Quantum mechanics emerged as a departure from classical mechanics, which described macroscopic phenomena using deterministic principles. Quantum mechanics introduced probabilistic principles, acknowledging that uncertainty inherent in quantum phenomena cannot be precisely predicted. This paradigm shift fundamentally altered our understanding of reality, introducing concepts such as wave-particle duality, uncertainty principle, entanglement, and superposition.
